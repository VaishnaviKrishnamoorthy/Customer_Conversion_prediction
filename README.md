# Customer_Conversion_prediction

# Description 
Custome Conversion Prediction  to Predict the Customer will Subscribe to Insurance or not Using Historical data. Done some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Find that This Dataset imbalanced data So using SMOTEN function balanced the data and applied all Machine Learning model and find the best  model to Predict. 

## Package 
This Project Requires Following Python packages

1.pandas

2.numpy

3.seaborn

4.scikit learn

# Road Map

1.Import The Required Packages

2.Import The Dataset

3.checking if the data is balanced or not and find that this is imbalanced data

4.Exploratory Data Analysis is Done to Obtain the Insights and to understand the distribution of the data

5.Done Encoding for Catagorical variable

6.Using SMOTEENN Balanced the data

7.Feature and Target variable are assigned 

8.Multiple Machine Learning Models are used to predict the sales price

9.Best Machine Learning model selected based on Evaluation Metric Score

10.Feature Importance is done to optimise the Best Model
